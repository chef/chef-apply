## Contributing/Development

Please read our [Community Contributions Guidelines](https://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html), and ensure you are signing all your commits with DCO sign-off.

The general development process is:

1. Fork this repo and clone it to your workstation.
2. Create a feature branch for your change.
3. Write code and tests.
4. Push your feature branch to GitHub and open a pull request against master.

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code. We do utilize RSpec for test driven development, so you'll need to get a development environment running. Follow the above procedure ("Installing from Git") to get your local copy of the source running.
