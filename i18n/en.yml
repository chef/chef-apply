  usage: |
    %1 <TARGET[S]> <RESOURCE> <RESOURCE_NAME> [PROPERTIES] [FLAGS]
    %1 <TARGET[S]> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]

  usage_full: |
    %1 <TARGET[S]> <RESOURCE> <RESOURCE_NAME> [PROPERTIES] [FLAGS]

      Runs a single <RESOURCE> on the specified <TARGET[S]>.
      [PROPERTIES] should be specified as key=value.

      For example:

        %1 web01 service nginx action=restart
        %1 web01,web02 service nginx action=restart
        %1 web0[1:2] service nginx action=restart

    %1 <TARGET[S]> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]

      Runs a single recipe located at <RECIPE> on the specified <TARGET[S]>.

      For example:

        %1 web01 path/to/cookbook/recipe.rb
        %1 web01,web02 path/to/cookbook
        %1 web0[1:2] cookbook_name
        %1 web01 cookbook_name::recipe_name

    ARGUMENTS:
      <TARGET[S]>       The hosts or IPs to target. Can also be an SSH or WinRM URLs
                        in the form:

                        ssh://[USERNAME]@example.com[:PORT]
      <RESOURCE>        A %2 resource, such as 'user' or 'package'
      <RESOURCE_NAME>   The name, usually used to specify what 'thing' to set up with
                        the resource. For example, given resource 'user', 'name' would be
                        the name of the user you wanted to create.
      <RECIPE>          The recipe to converge. This can be provided as one of:
                        1. Full path to a recipe file
                        2. Cookbook name. First we check the working directory for this
                           cookbook, then we check in the %3 repository path. If a
                           cookbook is found we run the default recipe.
                        3. This behaves similarly to 'cookbook name' above, but it also allows
                           you to specify which recipe to use from the cookbook.
  error:
    bad_config_file: |

    missing_config_path: |

      Missing configuration file.

      Please provide the path to a valid %1 configuration file
      as an argument to --config-path. For example:

        --config-path /home/user1/%2/config.toml

    invalid_config_key: |

      Invalid configuration entry.

      When loading '%2',
      the configuration entry '%1' was not recognized.

      same components including a supported %1.
