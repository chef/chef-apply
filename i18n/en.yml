    description: Show help and usage for `chef-run`
  usage: |
    chef-run <TARGET[S]> <RESOURCE> <RESOURCE_NAME> [PROPERTIES] [FLAGS]
    chef-run <TARGET[S]> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]

  usage_full: |
    chef-run <TARGET[S]> <RESOURCE> <RESOURCE_NAME> [PROPERTIES] [FLAGS]

      Runs a single <RESOURCE> on the specified <TARGET[S]>.
      [PROPERTIES] should be specified as key=value.

      For example:

        chef-run web01 service nginx action=restart
        chef-run web01,web02 service nginx action=restart
        chef-run web0[1:2] service nginx action=restart

    chef-run <TARGET[S]> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]

      Runs a single recipe located at <RECIPE> on the specified <TARGET[S]>.

      For example:

        chef-run web01 path/to/cookbook/recipe.rb
        chef-run web01,web02 path/to/cookbook
        chef-run web0[1:2] cookbook_name
        chef-run web01 cookbook_name::recipe_name

    ARGUMENTS:
      <TARGET[S]>       The hosts or IPs to target. Can also be an SSH or WinRM URLs
                        in the form:

                        ssh://[USERNAME]@example.com[:PORT]
      <RESOURCE>        A Chef resource, such as 'user' or 'package'
      <RESOURCE_NAME>   The name, usually used to specify what 'thing' to set up with
                        the resource. For example, given resource 'user', 'name' would be
                        the name of the user you wanted to create.
      <RECIPE>          The recipe to converge. This can be provided as one of:
                        1. Full path to a recipe file
                        2. Cookbook name. First we check the working directory for this
                           cookbook, then we check in the chef repository path. If a
                           cookbook is found we run the default recipe.
                        3. This behaves similarly to 'cookbook name' above, but it also allows
                           you to specify which recipe to use from the cookbook.
