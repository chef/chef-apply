      The target does not have chef-client installed.

      This command is powered by the Chef client.  In order to make use of it
      on this node, the Chef client must be installed first.

      Re-running this command without the '--no-install' flag will
      automatically perform the installation.

  CHEFINS003: |
    The target's installed version of Chef Client is too old.

    Version %1 is installed, but this command requires a
    minimum version of %2 (Chef 13) or %3 (Chef 14).

  CHEFINS004: |
    The target's installed version of Chef Client is too old.

    Version %1 is installed, but this command requires a
