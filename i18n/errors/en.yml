      The target does not have chef-client installed.

      This command is powered by the Chef client.  In order to make use of it
      on this node, the Chef client must be installed first.

      Re-running this command without the '--no-install' flag will
      automatically perform the installation.

  CHEFINS003: |
    The target's installed version of Chef Client is too old.

    Version %1 is installed, but this command requires a
    minimum version of %2 (Chef 13) or %3 (Chef 14).

  CHEFINS004: |
    The target's installed version of Chef Client is too old.

    Password required for sudo.

    This target requires a password to perform sudo operations.  Please provide a
    password using the --sudo-password option. For example if the sudo password is
    in the environment variable $CHEF_RUN_SUDO_PASSWORD, you could use:

    --sudo-password $CHEF_RUN_SUDO_PASSWORD

    In order to continue, sudo must be configured to no longer require tty.
    You can do this by modifying /etc/sudoers:

    For all users:
      Defaults !requiretty

    Per-user:
      Defaults:username !requiretty

  CHEFTRN007: |
    No authentication methods available.

    Try...
    - Provide a password with "--password PASSWORD"

    - Enable ssh-agent and add keys
    - Add a host entry to your ssh configuration
